* Default amount of clients to be launched is 2, you will be asked to provide a different amount if needed.
* Clients will use usernames test1, test2... testN with passwords set to "123456", all these users need to be registered on the server beforehand.

2. x - stop every launched application.

* Closes the server and client windows.
